{"name":"barinek/flagship","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe \"Flagship\" Java project is inspired by the recent buzz around [12factor applications](http://12factor.net) and [Microservices](http://12factor.net).\r\n\r\nThe example is slightly more inspired by the notion that everyone should understand how to build Microservices from scratch with just a few dependencies. Most of the recent apps I've build tend to start with the basic concepts and app structure described below. There are also several open source projects that start with similar foundations; [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/) are a few examples.\r\n\r\nAs applications grow (multiple apps, multiple services), I'm also a slight fan of having all the services or components within large systems reside in a single, versioned repo.\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\nThe example walks you through a basic Java Microservice in a few steps. For illustration purposes, I've captured the steps via the below Git tags -\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit tag -ln\r\n\r\nv0.1            Initial App\r\nv0.2            Introducing Guice and App Environment\r\nv0.3            Introducing Jetty and Jersey\r\nv0.4            Introducing HealthChecks and Jackson\r\nv0.5            Basic persistence with MyBatis and MySQL\r\n```\r\n### Initial App\r\n\r\n### Introducing Guice and App Environments\r\n\r\n### Introducing Jetty and Jersey\r\n\r\n### Basic persistence with MyBatis and MySQL\r\n\r\nThanks!
